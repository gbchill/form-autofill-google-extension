# Latest Fix: Radio Button and Checkbox Grouping

## Problem Identified

From your console log, the extension was creating **separate groups** for each individual radio button and checkbox instead of grouping them together by their parent question.

### What Was Wrong:
```
Radio group 0: "Chalenge" (1 button)
Radio group 1: "Battle" (1 button)
Radio group 2: "Challenge as a team" (1 button)
Radio group 3: "Would you like..." (1 button - should have all 4!)
```

This caused:
- Radio buttons couldn't be selected (only 1 option per "group")
- Checkboxes weren't being filled (each checkbox was its own group)
- Extension filled 2/10 fields instead of 6/6

### Root Cause:
The `getGoogleFormQuestionText()` function was returning the individual button's `aria-label` (e.g., "Chalenge", "Monday") instead of finding the parent question (e.g., "Would you like to challenge...").

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `getParentQuestionForChoice()` Function
A new function that specifically looks for the **parent question** by:
- Traversing up the DOM tree (up to 25 levels)
- Looking for heading elements (`[role="heading"]`, `.M7eMe`, etc.)
- Filtering out individual choice labels (Monday, Tuesday, Chalenge, etc.)
- Returning the actual question text that groups choices together

### 2. Updated Radio Button Grouping
- Now uses `getParentQuestionForChoice()` instead of `getGoogleFormQuestionText()`
- Uses the full question text as the grouping key
- Added detailed logging to show each button and which group it belongs to

### 3. Updated Checkbox Grouping
- Same approach as radio buttons
- Groups all checkboxes under the same parent question
- Better logging to debug issues

## Expected Results

After reloading the extension, you should see:

### Console Log:
```
üîò Found 4 radio buttons
   Radio 0: "Would you like to challenge, challenge as a team, or battle next week?..."
   Radio 1: "Would you like to challenge, challenge as a team, or battle next week?..."
   Radio 2: "Would you like to challenge, challenge as a team, or battle next week?..."

```

### Form Filling:

- **Practice days**: Monday, Thursday ‚úì
- **Challenge days**: Monday, Thursday ‚úì
- **Challenge target**: Mitch ‚úì

## How to Test

1. **Reload Extension:**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Form AutoFiller ‚Üí Click reload button
   ```

2. **Close all Google Form tabs**

3. **Open form in a fresh tab**

4. **Watch the console** - You should see much better grouping logs

5. **The form should auto-fill completely** within 1-3 seconds

6. **If auto-submit is enabled**, the form will submit automatically

## Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:
1. Check console for the new detailed logs (üîò ‚òëÔ∏è üìä emojis)
2. Look for "Total fields detected: 6" (not 7 or 10)
3. Ensure each radio/checkbox group shows multiple elements
4. Send me the new console log if issues persist
